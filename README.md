#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. Software engineering helps to develop software systems that provide solutions to users.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The first milestone was the development of programming languages such as Fortran C. Fortran C was developed by John Backus and was used to solve scietific and mathematical problems

The Second Milestone was the establishment of software engineering as a discipline. This establishment was due to the increased software crisis of the 1970s and 1980s which called for a discipline to address the problems of software development

The third milestone was the rise of structured programming in the 1970s. Structured programming aims to improve the reliability and clarity of programs.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The first phase if the requirement phase. This phase involves gathering the user needs and system requirements. Under this phase, the team collects information from stakeholders including analysts, users and clients.

The second phase is the design phase. In this phase, the team outline the software's functionality and aesthetic. The team creates high level designs of the software architecture and detailed designs.

The third phase is the implementation phase. In this phase, software engineers convert the software design into a code. This is through an appropriate programming language such as Java.

The fourth phase is the testing phase. In this phase, the team conducts various tests to enusre that the software meets the quality standards. This phase involves a thorough examination for bugs and glitches that might have slipped through during the implementation phase.

The fifth phase is the deployment phase. This phase involves rolling out the implemented  and tested software to the end users. The phase also involves creating user manuals and offering site support which ensures that the user can navigate through the software with ease.

The last phase is the maintainance phase. This phase involves providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software. It is a continuous process.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall model is a model under the Software Developing Life Cycle where the progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards. Under this model, the next phase in software development can only begin when the previous phase is completed. This model is useful in cases whereby projects do not have changing requirements or where the customer has a very clear document requirement.

Agile methodologies on the other hand, involves an iterative approach. Consequently, the team breaks down the project into smaller parts and delivers the completed smaller parts in regular cycles. This model is useful where a customer needs to have a functional requirements in less than 3 weeks or where the requirements are not clear enough.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer wirtes the code and implements software solutions.

A quality assurance engineer ensures that the software maintains its quality by designing and executing test plans

A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software products.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive tools ofr writing, debugging and testing code. IDEs make software evelopemnt more efficient by providing a hub for common developer tools which helps software developers to programme new applications quickly instead of manually integrating and configuring software. Examples include NetBeans and Visual Studio.

VCS on the other hand contain software tools that track changes to source code and coordinates work among the team. VCS assist in recording changes made to files by tracking the modifications on the source code. Examples include GitHub and DevOps.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

One of the challenges is lack of workflow visibility. This challenge is spurred by an inadequate understanding of the engineering processes, lack of communication on deadlines and deliverables. This challenge can be overcome by prioritizing effective communication and making use of project management tools.

Another key challenge is broken SDLC processes. This is caused by poor requiement driving and inadequate testing among other causes. This challenge can be remedied by constantly inspecting, detecting and fixing the root causes of persistent SLDC blockers.

Lastly, software engineers also face the challenge of the lack of predictability in software delivery. This may be due to a change in requirements which may lead to scope creep and an increase in the project budget. One solution to this is switching to the agile model which helps fight unpredicatbility. Once can also strengthen the SDLC processes through code review and constant testing.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing- This involves esring individual components or modules of software.

Integration testing- This comprises of testing interactions between different components or subsytems.

System testing- This involves testing the software as a whole

Acceptance testing- This involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure that it complies with the users' needs and preferences.

These types of testing in quality assurance help in fixing defects early in the development process which ultimately leads to higher quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the act of crafting specific, clear and concise questions or instructions in a way that helps an AI tool to give the best response. Clear and specific prompts help one to have a better interaction with AI models as they get the desired response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt example on Copilot: Generate a photo of students reading a book
This prompt is vague as it does not consider the context ie Race, location, what kind of book?
To improve on this, if say I want an image of Kenyan Students in University reading a book on philosophy, i can improve the prompt.

The improved prompt will now read: Generate an image of a group of Kenyan Students (boys and girls) in the university hall, reading books on philosophy

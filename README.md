# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. Software engineering helps to develop software systems that provide solutions to users.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The first milestone was the development of programming languages such as Fortran C. Fortran C was developed by John Backus and was used to solve scietific and mathematical problems
The Second Milestone was the establishment of software engineering as a discipline. This establishment was due to the increased software crisis of the 1970s and 1980s which called for a discipline to address the problems of software development
The third milestone was the rise of structured programming in the 1970s. Structured programming aims to improve the reliability and clarity of programs.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
